This is a fan-made Ezio's Hideout from Assassin's Creed Brotherhood. I made this level to practice level designing. All the 3D models are made by me in Blender, Rendered in Unreal Engine 4.22.
Textures used in this project are taken from different sources:
- textures.com
- Quixel Megascan
- 3DJungle.net
- 3dtextures.me/2020/06/16/candle-001/        (For amazing candle texture)
- Assassin's Flag texture was taken from the original game.
